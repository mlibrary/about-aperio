JMPhil is now accepting submissions and will publish papers on the history of philosophy from the 16th century through the 18th century up to, but not including, Kant. This new and fully open access journal is free of charges for both authors and readers. The founding editors are Antonia LoLordo, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Virginia, and Aaron Garrett, Associate Professor of Philosophy at Boston University.

Here is the announcement from the editors and the editorial board:\
The Journal of Modern Philosophy is now soliciting submissions in the history of philosophy from the 16th century to the 18th century up to, but not including, Kant. It is the goal of this journal to meet a clear need for a specialist journal in the history of modern philosophy. We welcome all papers that fall within the general category of modern philosophy, but we are especially eager to receive papers on under-represented figures and topics. We plan to expand to Kant and the nineteenth century in the future, and will at present consider submissions on underrepresented topics and authors in the nineteenth century. We also welcome reviewers who wish to be enrolled with the journal.

JMPhil is Open Access, authors will maintain their copyright, and submissions will be published on a rolling basis. All submissions will be double anonymously refereed, with a target turnaround time of ten weeks.

For more information on the journal and how to submit, please go to: http://www.jmphil.org/

Yours,\
Antonia LoLordo (UVa) & Aaron Garrett (BU) Co-Editors\
Margaret Atherton (UWM), Chair of the Editorial Board\
Editorial Board: Lili Alanen, Martha Bolton, Dan Garber, Don Garrett, Susan James, Laurent Jaffro, Christia Mercer, Steven Nadler

JMPhil is supported by the Departments of Philosophy at UVA and BU as well as BU’s Center for the Humanities.
