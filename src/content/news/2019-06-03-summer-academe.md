Summer Academe provides university and college administrators, deans and directors of summer sessions, and faculty involved in teaching and programming in summer sessions with a source of current research and best practices in summer session administration and pedagogy. In May 2019, the journal moved to Aperio, the University of Virginia’s open access press. It was hosted from 2013-2019 at the University of Manitoba and began as a print publication in 1997.

Summer Academe, an open access journal, is committed to being freely and immediately available to summer session professionals and readers everywhere. The journal is sponsored by the North American Association of Summer Sessions and the Association of University Summer Sessions. The editorial board represents both professional organizations, and Rachel Nottingham Miller serves as the academic editor.
