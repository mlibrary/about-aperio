Today is an exciting day at the University of Virginia. We’re excited to launch Aperio, a new open access press and collaboration between the UVA Library and UVA Press. This moment represents the beginning of a new chapter for our University and a new spin on an old mission. We’re going to “advance, preserve, and disseminate knowledge” by making it open access (and thereby removing price and permission barriers) for a global audience in a variety of formats.

We are leading with Aperio Journals, which is operated by the UVA Library, and will begin publishing discipline-leading, high-quality, peer reviewed journals this year. Aperio’s portfolio will also include open educational resources, open monographs, conferences, and other forms of research and scholarship.

This is an exciting time to be a scholarly publisher and the number of new open access presses attests to that. After careful consideration, we decided to join the Ubiquity Partner Network because of the level of service and features that Ubiquity Press allows us to offer to our authors, editors, reviewers, and readers.

We encourage you to learn more about Aperio and our goals. Follow us on Twitter (@AperioUVA) and join our mailing list to stay in touch.

Finally, we’d like to thank everyone who lent advice and support or made contributions to Aperio as the service was developed. We’re looking forward to a bright future.
