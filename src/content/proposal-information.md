<h2 id="scope">Scope and Eligibility</h2>
A venture of the University of Virginia Library, Aperio draws upon the strengths of the University to increase open access to knowledge for a global audience in a variety of formats. By making all of our publications open access—and removing price and permission barriers for readers everywhere—we increase the dissemination, visibility, accessibility, and impact of research and scholarship across the disciplines. We currently support the open access publishing of journals, monographs, edited volumes, open textbooks and other educational resources, and will consider other publication types well. Aperio’s publishing scope reflects the various fields of knowledge, including new and interdisciplinary lines of inquiry.

Currently, Aperio is accepting proposals from University of Virginia faculty, staff, and students.

If you would like to publish with Aperio, please review our policies and the following pages based on your desired format before emailing <a href="mailto:publish@virginia.edu">publish@virginia.edu</a> to set-up an initial consultation.

</ul>

<h2 id="deadlines">Deadlines</h2>
Proposals are accepted on a rolling basis and are evaluated on a quarterly basis beginning on the first days of business in January, April, July, and October.

<h2 id="review">Review Process</h2>
All journal proposals and expressions of interest will first be evaluated by Aperio staff to determine whether they fit within our scope and policies. Proposers may be asked to edit proposals and provide more information for us to determine a project's feasibility and prepare proposals for review.

Proposals that receive two positive external reviews will be sent to the Aperio Advisory Board. Proposals that are accepted by the Advisory Board must also obtain final approval from the Aperio Management Team. Decisions will be shared with proposers as soon as possible, and project planning will commence immediately with those who are accepted.

<h2 id="students">Student Publications</h2>
Student-led publications must have a faculty advisor or be sponsored by a UVA academic unit (ex. department, school, etc.).
